## Code Explanation:

This Swift code demonstrates protocol-oriented programming and inheritance using a bird-themed example.

# Key Components:

1.- CanFly Protocol: Defines a contract that any flying object must implement a fly() method.
2.- Bird Class: The base class with:

isFemale property to track gender
layEgg() method that only works for female birds
3.- Eagle Class: Inherits from Bird and conforms to CanFly protocol, demonstrating that eagles can both fly and lay eggs.
4.- Penguin Class: Inherits from Bird but cannot fly (doesn't conform to CanFly), showing that not all birds can fly.
5.- FlyingMuseum Struct: Demonstrates polymorphism by accepting any object that conforms to CanFly protocol.
6.- Airplane Struct: Shows that non-bird objects can also conform to CanFly protocol, demonstrating the flexibility of protocols.

# Key Concepts Demonstrated:

- Protocols: Define capabilities without implementation
- Inheritance: Eagle and Penguin inherit from Bird
- Polymorphism: FlyingMuseum can work with any CanFly object
- Protocol Conformance: Both Eagle (biological) and Airplane (mechanical) can fly
